   	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
   	    <p>Hello! I am Monisha Ramesh from the Business and Information Science Department.I am currently in my First Semester at NJIT.
           I enjoy swimming, travelling and socializing.Looking forward to a great experience.
        </p>
   	<h2>ACADEMIC GOALS</h2>
   	     <p>I have an undergraduate degree in Information Science Engineering which allowed me to gain interest in this domain and learn about languages like Java, C, C++, SQL and more.
         I am looking forward to broaden my business and technical knowledge in my masters.I strongly feel that NJIT with its strong international student body will give me the best opportunity to develop myself, not only in terms of education but, as a person as well.
         </p>
   	<h2>PROFFESIONAL GOALS</h2>
   	     <p>I am currently a masters student majoring in Information Systems who is eager to learn as well as to contribute in a substantial way to the organisation.
         With a short term perspective in mind, in the next couple of years, my ambition is to work for Industrial giants such as Apple or Microsoft as both my technical and management interests are closely related to these sectors.
         In the long run, after getting a couple of years of work experience under my belt, I would like to complete a Masters in Business Administration as it would further diversify my skill set and would also enable me to look at things with a different perspective. I am certain, with the right guidance and push, I will flourish under the pressure and expectation and I see no better place to further my career than at NJIT. 
        </p>

   	<h2>TECHNOLOGY USED</h2>
   	    <p>I have so far used C (Including Data Structures and Algorithm), Java, C++, php, SQL, HTML.
           Operating Systems Worked On:LINUX Mint, UBUNTU 14.04 LTS, Windows.
         </p>
